# Youâ€™re given two dataframes: transactions and products.
#
# The transactions dataframe contains transaction ids, product ids, and the total amount of each product sold.
#
# The products dataframe contains product ids and prices.
#
# Write a function to return a dataframe containing every transaction
# with a total value of over \$100$100. Include the total value of the transaction as a new column in the dataframe.
